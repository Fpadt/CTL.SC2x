# Week 2

[Welcome](https://youtu.be/918HCFR2dmA)

# Lesson 1

[VIDEO 1: FACILITY LOCATION MODELS](https://youtu.be/fbJAaJSBJ5w)

## QQ1
Which of the following models or techniques will not be discussed in this lesson?

1. Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP)  
2. Center of Gravity model  
3. Transportation model  
4. Minimum Weighted Distance (Weber) model

answer: 3

###EXPLANATION

We will be discussing all but the Transportation Problem - 
since we covered that in the previous lesson!

[VIDEO 2: CONTINUOUS LOCATION MODELS](https://youtu.be/QKg-XqLMhDc)

```{r Weber, results=fResults, echo=fEcho, eval=fEval}
wk <- c(425, 320, 220)
xk <- c(100, 86 , 20)
yk <- c(80 , 40 , 60)

fn1 <- function(x){
  sum(wk * sqrt( (x[1] - xk)^2 +(x[2] - yk)^2))
}

x0  <- c(round(sum(xk)/3, 0), round(sum(yk)/3, 0))
sol <- solnp(pars = x0, fun = fn1, LB = c(0, 0), UB = c(200, 200 ))
x   <- sol$pars[1]
y   <- sol$pars[2]

TWDW <- sum(wk * sqrt( (x - xk)^2 +(y - yk)^2))
AWDW <- TWDW/sum(wk)
```

```{r CoG, results=fResults, echo=fEcho, eval=fEval}
wk <- c(425, 320, 220)
xk <- c(100, 86 , 20)
yk <- c(80 , 40 , 60)

x <- sum(xk * wk / sum(wk))
y <- sum(yk * wk / sum(wk))

TWDC <- sum(wk * sqrt( (x - xk)^2 +(y - yk)^2))
AWDC <- TWDC/sum(wk)
```

##QQ2  
Suppose that you are trying to set up an ice cream stand on the beach. 
The beach is an absolutely straight line that stretches one mile. At one end 
of the beach (call this position 0) there is a hotel that will have 100 people 
wanting ice cream. On the other end (call this position 1) there is another 
hotel that will have 50 people who want your ice cream.

Part A. Using the Center of Gravity method, where along the beach should you 
set up your ice cream stand? Enter your answer in miles (two decimal places) 
from position 0. For example, if you think it should be located right in the 
middle you would enter 0.50. If you think it is 0.10 miles from position 0, 
enter 0.10.

```{r QQ2CoG, results=fResults, echo=fEcho, eval=fEval}
wk <- c(100, 50)
xk <- c(0  , 1)

x <- sum(xk * wk / sum(wk))

```

 0.33 
 
Part B. Using the Weber model, where would you locate it? Enter your answer in miles (two decimal places) from position 0. For example, if you think it should be located right in the middle you would enter 0.50. If you think it is 0.10 miles from position 0, enter 0.10.

```{r QQ2Weber, results=fResults, echo=fEcho, eval=fEval}
wk <- c(100, 50)
xk <- c(0  , 1 )

fn1 <- function(x){
  sum(wk * sqrt( (x[1] - xk)^2 )) 
}

x0  <- c(0.5)
sol <- solnp(pars = x0, fun = fn1, LB = c(0), UB = c(1))
x   <- sol$pars[1]

```

0

##EXPLANATION

OK, for the Center of Gravity this is: =(0)100150+(1)50150= 0.33. So, for the first part - we locate 1/3 of a mile away from the first hotel. For the Weber model we want to select x to minimize this function: 100(0−x)2−−−−−−−√+50(1−x)2−−−−−−−√=100x+50(1−x)=50x+50. By observation, we can see that the value for x that minimize function is 0! So, to minimize people-distance traveled we would locate at 0, that is the big hotel at position 0.

The average distance a person would travel for part A is =100(.33)+50(.67)150 = 0.44 miles. For part B it is =100(0)+50(1)150 = 0.33 miles. The COG method finds the point where the two people-distances are equal (the balancing point) while the Weber method minimizes the expected distance traveled! But realistically, I would just set up two ice cream stands - one at each end of the beach!

[VIDEO 3: NETWORK FACILITY LOCATION](https://youtu.be/3gq5MgtakiA)

##QQ 3  
In a network facility optimization problem, the logical or linking constraint is very important. It ensures that if any flow leaves a facility, that the facility is actually opened. Which of the following is the correct form for the logical or linking constraint?

1. xij−Yi  ≤0 for all ij  
2. xij−MYi ≥0 for all ij  
3. xij−MYi ≤0 for all ij  
4. xij−MYi =0 for all ij
